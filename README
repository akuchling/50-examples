# Practice Examples


Contains the text of a book describing interesting examples of Python
programming for use in teaching.  An alternate title was "The Python
Teaching Cookbook".  The examples are written for Python 3 (3.2 was
used).

Requires Sphinx for formatting; once you have Sphinx installed, type
"make" to see the available targets in the Makefile.  "make html"
will create an HTML version of the book in the build/ directory.
