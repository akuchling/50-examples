Structure
---------

Each example is no more than 5-10 pages.

Aiming for 50 examples, or 30-60.

Uses Python3 and the turtle module for graphics throughout.

May use third-party libraries to avoid having re-implement basic
data structures from scratch.

Look through: the A.K. Dewdney books; Cormen-Leiserson-Rivest; Sedgewick.
